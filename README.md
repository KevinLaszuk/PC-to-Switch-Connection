# üñ•Ô∏èPC-to-Switch-Connection

## Overview
This lab involved modeling a simple Ethernet network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The purpose of this assignment was to explore Layer 1 (Physical Layer) of the OSI Model and test end-to-end connectivity.

## Objectives
- Understand and simulate a basic Ethernet LAN.
- Use a /24 private IP range (192.168.5.x) for addressing.
- Use the `ping` command to verify Layer 3 connectivity.
